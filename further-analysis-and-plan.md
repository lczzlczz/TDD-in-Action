# Further Analysis and Plan

## Analysis

From the [survey](./plan-survey-result.md), we might divide our team into 3 groups based on the `deadline`:
1. Group 1: > 20 hours weekly, 1 month deadline: `@Chen-Java-3 @Marin-Java-5 @Singway`
2. Group 2: 5 - 10 hours weekly, 2 - 3 months deadline: 
`@rtw1258-Java-2 @Biluata_Python_7 @L-Java-4 @Felix-Java-8 @Hoodie-Java-4 @卷心菜-Java-1 @Id-java-3`
3. Group 3: 5 - 20 hours weekly, deadline > 4 months, `@ian-Java-0 @Lucy-JS-7 @长歌-Java-1 @hou-Java-1 Dongxu Java-6`


However, we might need to consider the following factors:

1. The expected hours might be more than our hope(from the [survey](./plan-survey-result.md)).

2. The actual learning hours required might be more than the expected hours, so we might need to increase the `weekly time investment` and `deadline`.

Let's look at the following tables:

Videos hours per project:
| Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4h 7m 39 s | 10h 57m 12s | 15h 49m 59s |  0h 46m 38s | 31h 41m 28s |

Learning hours per project(based on experience would be 5x of the videos hours, including document reading, discussing, coding, and other project related activities.):

| Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20h 38m 15s | 54h 51m 00s | 79h 09m 55s |  3h 53m 10s | 158h 32m 20s |

Weeks(5 hrs / week) required per project:
| Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 weeks | 11 weeks | 16 weeks |  1 week | 32 weeks |

Weeks(10 hrs / week) required per project:
| Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 weeks | 6 weeks | 8 weeks |  1 week | 17 weeks |

Weeks(20 hrs / week) required per project:
| Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 week | 3 weeks | 4 weeks |  1 week | 9 weeks |

Weeks(40 hrs / week) required per project:
| Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 week | 2 weeks | 2 weeks |  1 week | 6 weeks |

According to the tables above, we learnt that:
1. Compare to our hope, the expected learning hours required is about 8 months, 4 months, 2 months, 1 month for 5 hrs/week, 10 hrs/week, 20 hrs/week, 40 hrs/week respectively.
2. However, the efficiency of learning might be different for each individual, so the actual learning hours required might be different from the expected learning hours.
3. The efficiency of specific individual might be affected by learning hours per week, due to the learning curve, so the actual learning hours required might be higher than the expected hours if you increase the learning hours per week.
4. The statistics from internet, people can only work for 2 - 4 hours effectively per day.
5. Redefining the groups:
   1. group 1: > 40 hrs/week, 1 month deadline.
   2. group 2: 20 hrs/week, 2 - 3 months deadline.
   3. group 3: 10 hrs/week, 4 months deadline.
   4. group 4: 5 hrs/week, 8 months deadline.

Suggestions:

1. For group 1, you should:
   1. Increase your weekly time investment to > 40 hrs/week, but the long term learning efficiency might be affected.
   2. Increase your deadline to 2 months and join group 2.
   3. Don't learn the whole course, learn some of the projects or the key points, but this will affect your learning experience.
2. For group 2, 
   1. If you resist the deadline 2 - 3 months, you should increase your weekly time investment to 20 hrs/week(3 hrs/day)
   2. If you would like to extend your deadline to 4 months, keep your weekly time investment to 10 hrs/week.
   3. If you would like to have 8 months budget, go for 5 hrs/week and join group 3.
   4. Also, like group 1, you can learn some of the projects or the key points, but this will still affect your learning experience.
3. For group 3, it might be the best choice for most of the participants, you can keep your weekly time investment to 10 hrs/week, and extend your deadline to 4 months. You will have enough time to learn the whole course, and have a good learning experience.
4. For those who would like to have 8 months budget, you can join group 4 and keep your weekly time investment to 5 hrs/week.
