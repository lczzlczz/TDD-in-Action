# Survey Analysis

## The results(some)

### 1. What is your programming language?
80% of the participants are using Java, 20% are using other languages.

### 2. What is your most used testing framework?
Mostly Junit, some TestNG, and some other frameworks.

### 3. What is your TDD experience?
14/15 of the participants have no/few TDD experience, only 1 have some experience.

### 4. Starting point of TDD learning?
Half of the participants haven't started learning TDD, 1/3 of the participants are in Project 1, and rest of them are in Project 2.

### 5. How much time would you like to invest in TDD learning within 3 or 4 months every week?
40% of the participants would like to invest 5 hours, 40% of the participants would like to invest 10 hours, and 20% of the participants would like to invest 20 hours or more weekly.

### 6. What is your deadline for TDD learning?
20% of the participants would like to finish TDD learning within 1 month, about half of the participants would like to finish TDD learning within 2 - 3 months, and the rest of the participants would like to finish TDD learning within more than 4 months.

## Analysis

From the above results, we can conclude that most of the participants are using Java, and have no/few TDD experience. Meaning that the programming language we use and TDD experience are not the key factors for grouping participants. Neither the TDD experience nor tesing framework we use are.

Most of the participants would like to invest 5 - 10 hours weekly, and would like to finish TDD learning within 2 - 3 months.

The key factors for grouping participants are `weekly time investment` and `deadline`, we should group participants based on these two factors.

With the above analysis, we can have the following groups:

1. Group 1: > 20 hours weekly, 1 month deadline: `@Chen-Java-3 @Marin-Java-5 @Singway`
2. Group 2: 5 - 10 hours weekly, 2 - 3 months deadline: 
`@rtw1258-Java-2 @Biluata_Python_7 @L-Java-4 @Felix-Java-8 @Hoodie-Java-4 @卷心菜-Java-1 @Id-java-3`
3. Group 3: 5 - 20 hours weekly, deadline > 4 months, `@ian-Java-0 @Lucy-JS-7 @长歌-Java-1 @hou-Java-1 Dongxu Java-6`keep your weekly time investment to
